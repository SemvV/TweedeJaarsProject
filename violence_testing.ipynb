      "On 22 April 2018, during the night, the fifth of a five day sit-in protest at the central square of Mytilene town by at least 200 migrants - mostly Afghans and including women and children - turned violent when far-rightists of the radical Patriotic Movement tried to remove them by tossing rocks, fire bombs and other objects before being dispersed by police, who used stun grenades, tear gas and clubs, and left-wing activists who came to protect the protesters and their families. Greek police identified but did not arrest 16 members - the ringleaders - of far-right groups and they detained 118 migrants for illegal camping and 2 Greek activists who supported them. 10-28 or 30 people were transferred to the hospital for first-aid treatment. On 9 July 2024, 21 people were convicted for the attack against the protesting migrants. This was the first time that a court in Mytilene formally recognized racist motives in a crime.\n",
