            "On 19 May 2025, around 150 people, including Reich Citizens, gathered in front of the Kulturpalast in Dresden (Sachsen) for the regular Monday demonstration, promoting far-right ideologies. Around 50 people staged a counter-protest against far-right ideologies. During the event, protesters displayed a flag and clothing with symbols of the recently banned Reich Citizens group 'Kingdom of Germany' (Konigreich Deutschland) leading the authorities to seize the items and initiate an investigation for the use of unconstitutional symbols. Physical altercations and insults also occurred but the report does not provide details on what happened.\n",
